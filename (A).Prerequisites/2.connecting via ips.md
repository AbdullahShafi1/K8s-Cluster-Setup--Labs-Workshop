## Step 1: Set Hostnames for All Nodes

On each node, set the hostname using the following command:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>
```

For example:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname masternode
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname workernode1
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname workernode2
```

## Step 2: Add IP Addresses to /etc/hosts

Now, edit the `/etc/hosts` file to add the IP addresses and corresponding hostnames for all nodes:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following entries (replace ips with your actual ip address):

```bash
192.168.100.34 masternode
192.168.100.35 workernode1
192.168.100.36 workernode2
```

## Step 3: Test Connection Between Nodes

To test the connection, use the `ping` command to ensure all nodes can communicate with each other:

```bash
ping masternode
ping workernode1
ping workernode2
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the first part of the Kubernetes cluster setup. In the next part, we will install and configure the container engine, Containerd.
