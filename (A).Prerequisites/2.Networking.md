# Set Static IP on VMs

## 1. Find the Network Interface
Run the following command to list all network interfaces:

```bash
ip a
```

Look for the interface name of the network adapter you want to configure (e.g., `eth0` or `ens33`).

## 2. Edit Netplan Configuration File
Open the netplan configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

In this file, configure the static IP settings for your network interface. Replace `eth0` with the correct interface name, and adjust the IP address, netmask, and gateway as needed:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
      addresses:
        - 192.168.100.XX/24  # Change the IP address as needed
      gateway4: 192.168.100.1  # Your gateway IP
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8.8.8  # Google's DNS
          - 8.8.4.4  # Google's secondary DNS
```

Save and close the file.

## 3. Apply the Configuration
After saving the changes, apply the new network configuration using:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

This will immediately apply the static IP settings.

## 4. Disable Cloud-init Network Configuration (Optional)
If your VM uses cloud-init (common for cloud environments), you may want to disable its network configuration capabilities to prevent it from overriding your settings. Create a configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
```

Add the following content:

```yaml
network: {config: disabled}
```

Save and exit the file.

## 5. Confirm the Static IP Configuration
Check if the static IP has been applied successfully by running:

```bash
ip a
```

Ensure that your network interface (`eth0`) shows the configured static IP.

## 6. Test Network Connectivity
Test your network connectivity to ensure everything is working:

```bash
ping 192.168.100.1  # Ping your gateway
```

Optionally, you can ping an external server like Google's DNS:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

## 7. Reboot the System
To verify that the static IP persists after a reboot, restart the VM:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After the system restarts, check the IP configuration again:

```bash
ip a
```

Your static IP should still be applied.

## Step 1: Set Hostnames for All Nodes

On each node, set the hostname using the following command:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>
```

For example:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname masternode
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname workernode1
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname workernode2
```

## Step 2: Add IP Addresses to /etc/hosts

Now, edit the `/etc/hosts` file to add the IP addresses and corresponding hostnames for all nodes:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following entries (replace ips with your actual ip address):

```bash
192.168.100.34 masternode
192.168.100.35 workernode1
192.168.100.36 workernode2
```

## Step 3: Test Connection Between Nodes

To test the connection, use the `ping` command to ensure all nodes can communicate with each other:

```bash
ping masternode
ping workernode1
ping workernode2
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the first part of the Kubernetes cluster setup. In the next part, we will install and configure the container engine, Containerd.
