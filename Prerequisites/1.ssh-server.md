# Set Up SSH on Your Linux Machine

## 1. Install OpenSSH Server
Run the following commands to install OpenSSH on your Linux machine:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

## 2. Start and Enable SSH Service
Start the SSH service and enable it to run on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

## 3. Verify SSH Service Status
Check if the SSH service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```
You should see the service status as **active (running)**.

## 4. Find the Linux Machine's IP Address
To find the IP address of your Linux machine, use the `ip` command:
```bash
ip addr
```
Look for the `inet` address under your network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`). This is your machine's IP address.
