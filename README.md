# Kubernetes Cluster Setup and Practicals

In this workshop, we will first set up the Kubernetes cluster and then move on to practical tasks, covering a range of topics included in the CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator), CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer), and CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist) certification labs.
If you want to see all the commands I run on my master cluster then all the history is captured in "logs" folder.
